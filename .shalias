# Wow holy fucking shit you're parsing the output of ls? How careless are you?
#
# The ls here without a sort is good enough, but we pipe it into a stable sort,
# sorting on the colored file names from LS_COLORS. This causes the files in our
# directory to show up grouped by file type, alphabetically. It's hacky yeah,
# but it looks good.
