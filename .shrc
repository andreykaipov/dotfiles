#
# NOTE: Our shell of choice is Bash, but this file can be sourced from a POSIX
# shell.
#
# What should and should not go into this file? Well, since our local tmux
# session inherits the environment from the login shell that spawned it, any
# environment variables are available from within child tmux windows/panes too,
# so we don't need to source ~/.shenv here too. However, aliases and functions
# are not exportable, so we must source ~/.shalias and ~/.shfunction here. This
# is rather quick as functions and aliases defined via single quotes are lazily
# evaluated.
#
# But wait -- what happens if I want to update the environment during my tmux
# session? Shouldn't we also source ~/.shenv? No, because once everything is set
# up, the environment doesn't change often nor dynamically enough, so it doesn't
# merit exporting them as often as we create new tmux panes. However, when they
# they do change, it'd be very cumbersome relying on tmux inheriting the login
# shell's environment as it means us having to restart tmux and "logging in" all
# over again.
#
# Fortunately, there's a way around this! We can update tmux's global
# environment from within tmux itself. The `promote` function below does so.
# See https://stackoverflow.com/a/61882412/4085283 for more information.
#
# The workflow for updating environmental variables is to edit ~/.shenv as
# usual, and then run `promote ~/.shenv` instead of `. ~/.shenv` from the
# current shell. Any new tmux windows/panes will have our updated environment!
# This will also update the existing environment too, acting as a drop-in
# replacement for the `source` built-in.
#
# If we want to get really sophisticated in the future, we can set up a watch on
# ~/.shenv via inotify to run this function on changes to avoid doing so
# manually! But I'm not too crazy yet!
#
# By sourcing our file from a limited subshell, we avoid promoting any
# unnecessary env vars to the global tmux environment (e.g. we may have exported
# a one-time build env var that new shells don't need). Once we have every
# variable exported by the sourced file, we use indirect variable references to
# update our environment. The escaped quotes are necessary because of word
# splitting as values can potentially have leading/trailing spaces.
#
# Known limitations involve completely removing variables from our sourced file.
# We'd have to remove any of those from the global tmux environment ourselves.
