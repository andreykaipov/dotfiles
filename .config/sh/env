# Note this file uses a few commands like `tr` and `dircolors.hex` on our PATH
# to create environment variables, specifically the PATH var too. At first
# glance, this might be an issue from shells with an empty PATH. Thankfully,
# shells are smart and don't let you do this (unless you export PATH='' of
# course). For example, the following starts a shell with an empty environment,
# and prints out the environment:
#
# ```
# $ env - sh -c 'env; echo $PATH'
# PWD=/Users/andreyk
# SHLVL=1
# _=/usr/bin/env
# /usr/gnu/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:.
# ```
#
# This "empty" shell mimics our login shell and the `sourceg` function in
# ~/.shrc too. Note how among the environment variables printed, PATH is not
# among them. However, it still has a value. Nice. The above example is from
# a macOS 1.15+ machine. With this, we're able to use common tools to generate
# our other env vars. And once we generate our PATH, we can use it further in
# the script (for things outside of system paths, like ~/bin/dircolors.hex)!
#
# To test out all the env vars available from this file, run it from an empty
# shell and source it:
#
# ```
# env - "HOME=$HOME" sh -c '. $HOME/.shenv; env' | sort
# ```
#
# Note HOME is not implicit and has to be passed. See the `sourceg` function.
#
# Further, as this file contains subshell logic to form env vars, it's not
# recommended to source this file from every child shell. As it's only for env
# vars, it's enough to just let tmux inherit the login shell's environment, and
# expose that to each tmux pane. If changes to this file are necessary, and
# restarting tmux is a bitch because you've got 10 windows open, then that's
# what the `sourceg` function in ~/.shrc is for. However, at best, you're saving
# like 30ms each time you source this directly, so ehh who cares.
