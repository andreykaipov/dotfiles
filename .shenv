# Note this file uses a few commands like `tr` and `dircolors.hex` on our PATH
# to create environment variables. If sourced from a shell with an empty PATH,
# it'll fail. Thankfully, shells are smart and shouldn't let you do this. The
# following starts a shell with an empty environment. It's supposed to mimic our
# login shell and the envupdate function in ~/.shrc too.
#
# ```
# env - sh -c 'env; echo $PATH'
# ```
#
# The only env var output will be PWD. However, the PATH printed in this case
# will be the common **/sbin and **/bin directories. With this, we'll be able to
# re-export the path with `tr`, and any other dependent binaries like in ~/bin
# will be found. Having said that, there are a few env vars we do always need
# though:
# ```
# env - "HOME=$HOME" SHELL=sh sh -c '. $HOME/.shenv; env' | sort
# ```
#
# HOME and SHELL are not implicit and have to be passed. Again, see the
# envupdate function.
